**Abstract:**  For revolutionary regimes, transitioning from “seizing the state” to “governing the state” is a critical challenge to its legitimacy. This study explores how the political legacies of revolution strengthened the regime legitimacy through government-invested infrastructure projects like the rural electrification. Using GIS technology and historical archives, this study builds an original dataset on regions traversed by the Long March, an arduous and crucial strategic retreat by remnant Chinese Communist Red Army during the First Chinese Civil War. The findings show that counties crossed by the Red Army or in the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Revolutionary Base Areas during 1934–1936 (defined as “Long March Counties”) were more likely to get prioritized support for rural electrification from the central government during 1980s and 1990s. This pattern remains robust across propensity score matching, instrumental variable approaches, and a range of robustness checks. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that counties traversed by the Central Red Army got greater support than those crossed by other Red Army units, suggesting the role of core leadership's revolutionary activities during the “seizing the state” period in shaping resource allocation and local development during the “governing the state” period. Mediation analyses further indicate that, in efforts to strengthen the regime legitimacy, Long March Counties were more likely to be designated as poverty alleviation areas, leading to their prioritizations in allocation of electrification support and other policy resources. These findings contribute to research on state-building and local political-economic development, highlighting how revolutionary regimes strategically allocate policy resources across regions to strengthen their legitimacy.
